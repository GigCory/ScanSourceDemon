Implementation Process:

Refactor Country, Province, and Customer Models Based on SOLID Design Principles:

Ensure each model adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by focusing on a single aspect of the business logic.
Use encapsulation and other object-oriented principles to improve maintainability and scalability.
Refactor Service Files Using CQRS Design Pattern:

Separate the code into Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), command models, and repository models.
Implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to differentiate between command operations (create, update, delete) and query operations (read).
Add Validation for Email and Zip Code Textboxes:

Implement client-side and server-side validation to ensure that email and zip code inputs meet the required formats and constraints.
Use regular expressions or built-in validation attributes to enforce validation rules.
Add Delete and Update Customer Methods:

Implement methods for deleting and updating customer records in the database.
Ensure these methods follow best practices for error handling and data integrity.
